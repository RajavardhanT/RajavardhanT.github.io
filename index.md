# Books Read

+ <b>Pendulum: Leon Foucault and the Triumph of Science<b> by <i>Amir D. Aczel<i>
![Pendulum](Pendulum.jpg)

+  <b>Einstein's Masterwork: 1915 and the General Theory of Relativity<b> by <i>John Gribbin with Mary Gribbin<i>

![Einstein_Masterwork](Einstein_Masterwork.jpg)

	It outlines the crux of the Einstein's papers of the Annus Mirabilis and then about his Masterwork.

+  <b>EINSTEIN AND THE QUANTUM<b> by <i>A. Douglas Stone<i>

![Einstein_Stone](Einstein_Stone.jpg)

	It shows/proves the Einstein's contributions and his influence on the development on the Qunatum Theory / Quantum Mechanics. His genius in interpretting the works of Bose, de Broglie, Schordinger etc is wonderful. His courage in predicting BEC is breathtaking. He seems to have a huge influence on the leading scientists of the quantum mechanics not limited to Born, Heisenberg, Schrodinger etc.


+  <b>THE DAY WE FOUND THE UNIVERSE <b> by <i>Marcia Bartusiak<i>

![The_Day](The_day_we_found_the_universe.jpg)

	It shows the evolution of human's understanding of the universe by studying the stars. This book is nothing less than a thriller. It takes you through the twists and turns of the conclusions made at crucial steps and their over turns. The complex human interactions are  protrayed to a good detail. You will know why the "Hubble Telescope" is named after him.


+  <b>BLACK HOLE <b> by <i>Marcia Bartusiak<i>

![Black_Hole](Black_Hole.jpg | height=50)

	It starts from the Newton's times and then takes you to the brink of the evidence leading to the possibility of the "holy grail" of physics at the event horizon of a black hole. It is intersting to note the image on the cover corresponds to the validation of the Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. 



+  <b> Einstein : A LIFE IN SCIENCE <b> by <i>Michael White and John Gribbin<i>

![Einstein_Book](Einstein_Book.jpg)

	This shows why Einstein's name props in every discussion related to phyiscs. It takes you through a good journey of his life. Along the way, the scientific details are satifying and instills a sense of appreciation towards intellectual achievements themselves.

+ <b> Michael Faraday and The Royal Institution: The Genius of Man and Place   <b> by <i> John M. Thomas   <i>

![Faraday_Book](Faraday_Ri.jpg)

	I read this book on Prof [Andrew Zangwill's recommendation](https://shepherd.com/best-books/biographies-of-physicists).

Its a gem.

+  <b> Longitude <b> by  <i>Dava Sobel<i>

![Longitude_Dava_Sobel](Longitude.jpg)

	One will understand how many obstacles one should overcome to achieve something in the scientific world. This problem was know to Newton too. But he didn't propose a solution in his lifetime.


+  <b> The Monk who sold his Ferrari <b>

![Monk](Monk.jpg)

	I read this book multiple times. Though I am unable to put into practice all of its contents, this book changed my life to some extent.

+  <b>  Dispatches from Planet 3 <b> by  <i>Marcia Bartusiak<i>

# Novels

+  <b> THE STREET LAWYER <b> by <i>John Grisham<i>

	Depending on your personality, you will have a clear conclusion on what is important to you : Money or Social Service. This book in layers depicts the life of home less people and a lawyer who fights for them in a particular situation. By the end, you should be amazed by the balance John Grisham strikes.

+  <b> THE TESTAMENT <b> by <i>John Grisham<i>

	Money, Money, Money.  You just read it until the end for an unforgettable, sweet and  memorable experience in your life.
